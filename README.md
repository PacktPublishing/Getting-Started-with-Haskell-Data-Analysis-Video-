# Getting Started with Haskell Data Analysis [Video]
This is the code repository for [Getting Started with Haskell Data Analysis [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/getting-started-haskell-data-analysis-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
##  Data analysis is part computer science and part statistics. An important part of data analysis is validating your assumptions with real-world data to see if there is a pattern, or a particular user behavior that you can validate. This video course will help you get up to speed with the basics of data analysis and approaches in the Haskell language. You'll learn about statistical computing, file formats (CSV and SQLite3), descriptive statistics, charts, and onto more advanced concepts like understanding the importance of normal distribution. Whilst mathematics is a big part of data analysis, we’ve tried to keep this course simple and approachable so that you can apply what you learn to the real world.
<H2>What You Will Learn</H2>
<DIV class=book-info-will-learn-text>
<UL>
<LI> Learn to parse a CSV file and read data into the Haskell environmen
<LI>Create Haskell functions for the common descriptive statistics functions that you already know about: range, mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
<LI>Learn to create a SQLite3 database using an existing CSV file
<LI>Learn the versatility of the SELECT query for slicing data into smaller chunks.
<LI>Learn to apply regular expressions in large-scale datasets using both CSV files and SQLite3 files.
<LI>Learn to craft regular expressions through simple examples.
<LI>Understand the formula for normal distribution and how the parameters affect the shape of the distribution.
<LI>Learn to create a kernel density estimator visualization, which is an application of normal distribution.</LI></UL></DIV>

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge

This video course is intended for people who wish to expand their knowledge of statistics and data analysis via real-world examples. It’s not a programming course, and a basic understanding of the Haskell language is expected. If you are feeling brave, you can jump right into a functional programming style.
